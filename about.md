I am a junior year student at National Institute of Technology Karnataka, Surathkal, Mangalore, majoring in Metallurgical and Materials Engineering and minor in Computer Science and Engineering. I'm insanely passionate about computer programming, currently trying out a number of areas, ranging from Competitive Coding to Web Development. I have recently started contributing to the world of open source through [Processing Foundation](https://github.com/symengine/symengine).
